# üìò Hospital Management System SQL Project

## üìã Project Overview

A full-featured SQL Server-based Hospital Management System project designed to manage healthcare operations using relational database concepts, procedural SQL, and administrative tools.

GitHub Repository: [HospitalSystemDB](https://github.com/mohammed-alshabibi/HospitalSystemDB)

## üî∂ 1. ERD & Schema Mapping

* Designed and cleaned an Entity Relationship Diagram using draw\.io.
* Mapped entities: `Patients`, `Doctors`, `Departments`, `Staff`, `Appointments`, `Admissions`, `Rooms`, `MedicalRecords`, `Billing`, `Users`.
* Created relational schema with foreign key constraints.

## üèóÔ∏è 2. Table Creation with Constraints

* Implemented normalized tables using:

  * ‚úÖ Primary keys and foreign keys
  * ‚úÖ CHECK constraints, IDENTITY columns, and UNIQUE keys
* Linked `Doctors` to `Departments` via `DepartmentID` FK.
* Extended `Users` table with `DoctorID` and `StaffID` FKs.

## üß™ 3. Sample Data

* Inserted 20+ sample rows per table.
* Arabic names written in English (e.g., `Salim Al Farsi`, `Layla Al Hinai`).
* Ensured referential integrity for FK relationships.

## üìä 4. Query Examples

* ‚úÖ List all patients who visited a specific doctor.
* ‚úÖ Count of appointments per department.
* ‚úÖ Retrieve doctors with >5 appointments in a month.
* ‚úÖ Used `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, subqueries, and `EXISTS`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Stored Procedures & Functions

* `fn_CalculateAge`: Calculates patient age from DOB.
* `sp_AdmitPatient`: Admits a patient, updates room status.
* `sp_GenerateInvoice`: Creates billing record from treatment.
* `sp_AssignDoctorToDept`: Assigns doctor to department (with FK).

## üîÅ 6. Triggers

* üîÑ `AFTER INSERT` on `Appointments` ‚Üí logs record to `MedicalRecords`.
* üö´ `INSTEAD OF DELETE` on `Patients` ‚Üí prevents deletion if pending bills exist.
* üõèÔ∏è `AFTER UPDATE` on `Rooms` ‚Üí ensures room isn't double-assigned.

## üîê 7. Security (DCL)

* Roles: `DoctorUser`, `AdminUser`
* GRANT SELECT on `Patients` and `Appointments` to `DoctorUser`
* GRANT INSERT, UPDATE on all tables to `AdminUser`
* REVOKE DELETE on `Doctors`

## üîÑ 8. Transactions (TCL)

* Admitting a patient inside a transaction:

  * Insert into `Admissions`
  * Update `Rooms` availability
  * Insert into `Billing`
  * `TRY...CATCH` with `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`

## üîé 9. Views

* `vw_DoctorSchedule`: Lists upcoming appointments per doctor
* `vw_PatientSummary`: Shows latest visit info for each patient
* `vw_DepartmentStats`: Count of doctors and patients per department

## ‚è±Ô∏è 10. SQL Server Agent Jobs

### Doctor Daily Schedule Report

* Job Name: `Doctor_Daily_Schedule_Report`
* Time: 7:00 AM daily
* Procedure logs appointments to `DoctorDailyScheduleLog`

---

## üèÜ Bonus Features

### üìß Email Alert if Doctor Has >10 Appointments/Day

* Stored procedure `sp_CheckDoctorAppointments`
* Uses `sp_send_dbmail` to send email
* Scheduled SQL Agent Job: `Doctor_Alert_Email_Job`

### üì§ Weekly Billing Export to CSV

* Uses `bcp` utility:

```bash
bcp "SELECT * FROM HospitalSystem.dbo.Billing" queryout "C:\Exports\Billing_Weekly.csv" -c -t, -T -S DESKTOP-LGMU6P8
```

* SQL Agent job scheduled weekly
